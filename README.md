Generative adversarial Networks

This Jupyter Notebook provides you an adapted version of the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) on the tensorflow.org for four different functions: square, $x^2$, circle, and a function that only returns four points. This GAN example is developed after seeing a very similar example which was developed by Grégoire Delétang (see  [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-gans-really-work-2e1db1f407bb))
